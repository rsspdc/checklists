*[Research Software Sharing, Publication, & Distribution Checklist](https://rsspdc.org)* [[repo](https://gitlab.com/rsspdc/checklists)]

A database, API (application programming interface), or other web-based tool which is, generally, to be hosted on an ongoing basis and offer some service or access to some resource to researchers.
In many ways the key considerations here lean more organisational than technical.
Do you have the resources to operate the service on an ongoing basis?
A record of a specific analysis is a snapshot in time that is only expected to run in it's specified environment and once done is done.
Operating an online service requires continuous ongoing work to keep up with security updates and monitoring the status of your server(s) to ensure that your service is still up and working as intended.
You can also expect to take on some degree of user support from people having trouble using your service.
Depending on the nature of the project it may not make sense for others to be deploying instances of the server, but at minimum other developers will need a test deployment to work on if not now then in the future.

Most of the suggestions here would be the same as the section in the software packages checklist, and indeed software of this type is generally one or more packages so that checklist also applies here.
This checklist focuses on the things that are in addition to general packages and more specific to web-based services.


## 💽 Environment Management / Portability

*How can people get specific versions of your software running on their systems?*

- [ ] Simple to install development, testing, and/or demo environment
	- [ ]   🥉Bronze *(easy)*: A developer / sysadmin other than yourself can deploy a simple testing instance of your software using only your documentation.
	- [ ]   🥈Silver *(easy)*: 
		- [ ] Sensible security defaults. Such as not having default passwords, for databases or admin consoles and requiring the person deploying your service to configure them, hopefully with appropriate secrets management approaches.
	- [ ]   🥇Gold *(intermediate)*: 
		- [ ] Sensible security defaults. Such as not having default passwords, for databases or admin consoles and requiring the person deploying your service to configure them, hopefully with appropriate secrets management approaches.
	- [ ]   🏆Platinum *(hard)*: The entire dependency tree of your pipeline including the pipeline manager itself, the OS it's running on and the firmware of the hardware it's running on can be bootstraped from source and produce bitwise identical binaries, also including any pre-processing of data inputs to the pipeline such as base calling for sequencing data.
		- [ ] 
		- [ ] Deployment is possible on multiple architectures (such as x86_64 & ARM64)

	Depending on the infrastructure that you chose to deploy on you might use a different management tool, but it is best if you do use such a tool as a part of your development and deployment as, if done right, this provides an easy 'run a couple of commands' development environment setup for anyone picking up the project.
	Be that a future maintainer, someone wanting to play with a local test deployment, or someone wanting to contribute to the project.
	Examples of such tools include: [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), [docker](https://www.docker.com/)/[docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), [nix](https://nixos.org/), [helm charts](https://helm.sh/) or a combination of some of these that fits your needs and experience.
